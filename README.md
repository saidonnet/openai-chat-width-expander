OpenAI Chat Enhancer
This is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the user experience on chat.openai.com.

Features

Quick Copy: Adds a floating button labelled 'C' that, when clicked, copies the entire last generated message to your clipboard.

Text-to-Speech: Adds a floating button labelled 'S' that, when clicked, reads aloud the last generated message in the selected language. This is particularly useful when multitasking or wanting to rest your eyes.
